Create me a Verilog design which does the following 

1. Interfaces a Digilient Pmod AD2 which has a I2C inteface, this is four channel ADC but the design should only use the first channel - https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/ad7991_7995_7999.pdf
2. Interfaces a digilent Pmod DA4 which is a SPI interace, this is a eight channel DAC but the design should only use the lowest channel -https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/AD5628_5648_5668.pdf
3. Map the 12 bits from the ADC to the 14 bit output of the DAC - Map to highest bits
4. Create seperate files the PmodAD2 will be in its own module - outputing a AXI stream 
5. Create seperate files the PmodDA4 will be in its own module - inputputing a AXI Stream 
6. The clock will be 50 MHz - ADC and DAC will be accessed at 1 MHz e.g. SCL is 1MHz and SCk is 1 MHz
7. Data will be passed through from inptu to output directly 
8. Create a test bench to verify the i2C and SPI ADC and DAC interfaces and pass through 
9. Test Bench should be self checking 
10. use Questa sim which is on the path.
